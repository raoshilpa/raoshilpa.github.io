# It's nice to meet you! I'm Shilpa. 
[View my resume!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tpcRBcYsKHE2UQ1Cwv5wG-miIdunuv3/view?usp=sharing)

I think I'm majoring CS and something-engineering-sciencey at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), but I don't really know. Wait, I do go to UCLA. At least that part's for sure. 

Current:
- Undergraduate researcher at the [Structures-Computer Interaction La](https://structures.computer/). 
- Project lead for [Under The Hood](http://artsci.ucla.edu/under-the-hood) & employee at [the ArtSci Center at UCLA.](http://artsci.ucla.edu/)
- Co-founder and current board member of [STEAM Team](http://steamteamorg.weebly.com/)

Skills: 
Proficient in C++, Python, Fusion 360. Learning robot operating system (ROS).

Misc:
I recently started an interview series with my Nani to learn more about her life; I'll post it on youtube in the coming weeks.
I'm also on the electronics team at [UCLA Rocket Project](http://rocketproject.seas.ucla.edu/), working on the data acquisition for the in-flight electronics. When I'm back in the Bay Area, I coach for my old XCMTB team, [Black Mountain Composite](http://www.blackmountainmtb.org/).

Hobbies:
Writing, reading, mountain biking (and cycling)/hiking/backpacking/recently I've wanted to get more into alpine climbing. I did Shasta and it was way too fun, so I'm working on taking some (avalanche, wilderness first aid) classes and maybe hopefully I can land a side-gig as a mountain guide one day.

My current reading list is:
1. Magpie Murders by Anthony Horowitz
    1a. Ducks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellman 
2. The Committed by Viet Thanh Nguyen
3. Recursion by Blake Crouch
    3a. Ducks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellman 
4. Life of Pi by Yann Martel
5. Mr Tompkins in Paperback by George Gamow
    5a. Ducks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellman (seriously, I'm only ever going to get through it if I read it in chunks.)
I discovered recently that I really like historical fiction and science fiction. I want to read more of those. 

Past writing I've done: a [literary research paper on Jhumpa Lahiri's work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kcqNL44ae6O0nsqL5KTu3EWbf3StlrCORGjADGM4yYM/edit?usp=sharing), an [economic and technological essay on Covid-19 inspired innovation](https://medium.com/@shilpa.padiki.rao/covid-19-emerging-technologies-and-their-economic-implications-d46fa8c0f669), and a [personal blog](https://shilpaontheinternet.wordpress.com).
