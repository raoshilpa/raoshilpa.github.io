## [@provocationsproject on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/provocationsproject/)

This is a spinoff project based on the [provocations](provocations) page on this website. I started my Provocations page to list out my unfinished ideas, dreams, and the projects I have yet to start. This was inspired by [Period Futures'](https://www.periodfutures.org/) concept of purposely provocative, fictional and imaginative dreams for a future that is more accepting of women's menstruation and health. I think this concept is awesome, and I believe it can extend past women's health and move into the realm of being more accepting of one's own creativity and raw thought. Especially now, I believe women who are empowered in their ideas, and confident in themselves, can truly go a long way.

In support of Period Futures' initiative, I decided to take this idea one step further and apply it to all sorts of creative provocations, whether they be large or small. This project is a supportive effort for the most banal and fresh kinds of ideas out there.

Business ideas, a personal blog you've always wanted to start, mathematically modeling a sitcom laughtrack, making matlab for kindergarteners, calculating the volume of a mountain with revolution-by-integration, career dreams and way-too-specific goals: we should not be afraid of our ideas. The "stupid" ideas are the ones that change the way we think, anyway.

This Instagram account may be small, but it is my favorite way to spend my down time. This is my side hobby, a source of inspiration, and above all, my provocations.
